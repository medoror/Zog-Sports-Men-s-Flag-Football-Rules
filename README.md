Shift

Two or more offensive players may be shifting their position at the same time prior to the snap. Their movement may be in any direction but they must become set for one full count (1 second) before the ball is snapped or before another player may go in motion prior to the snap.
# Motion

Only 1 player is allowed to be in motion and his movement must be parallel to or away from the Line of Scrimmage (L.O.S.) in a continuous motion at the snap or the whole offense must re-set.
## Encroachment Offside

Encroachment Offside shall be called if either the offense or the defense passes over the plane of the L.O.S prior to the snap. A false movement of the football by the center shall constitute offensive encroachment. These are Dead Ball Fouls and the play shall be immediately whistled dead before play begins and 5 yards automatically marked off against the encroaching team unless a first down would occur (Offensive Captain's Choice). If declined by the offensive captain, the play will reset and the clock WILL STOP until the following snap.

If a player on either side lines up offside, the official will point toward that player's team side and say “neutral O or neutral D”. It is the player's responsibility to look and listen to the referee. If that player does not get back on side before the ball is snapped, he will be considered as having been offside at the moment of the snap.
Stances

OFFENSE: Any stance is permitted. DEFENSE: Any stance is permitted.
# Offensive Formation

## LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
Offensive team must have at least 3 players on the line of scrimmage.

## ELIGIBLE RECEIVERS
All players are eligible receivers.

## Blocking

During a legal block, defense and offense must initiate contact with open hands; arms extended outward (no elbows or loading up). Open hands can be thrust forward initially to contact an opponent inside the body frame (chest area only). Hands cannot be thrust forward above the shoulders to contact an opponent on the neck, face, or head. As the play develops, a blocker is permitted to work for and maintain position on an opponent as long as he does not push from behind or clip. If a defensive lineman turns his back to the offensive linemen while in contact there will be no penalty for blocking in the back. Open hand blocking is allowed on all portions of the field and is not restricted to the line of scrimmage.

Players cannot engage in a block beyond the line of scrimmage when the ball is in the air (10-yard penalty). If the ball is thrown and it is in the air behind the line of scrimmage then blocking is allowed (ie. screen passes).

Two on one blocking is permitted.
Note: This rule just means that it's ok for more than one player to engage in a block using their hands. It does not mean you can use your shoulder or cheap shot someone.
Defensive Formation

FORMATION: Defense may line up in any formation. There are no requirements for players on the LOS.

The Defense must initiate open-hands to the Offensive line in pursuit of getting to the quarterback and runner. Full rush is allowed by defense on every down.
Bump and Run

Contact is allowed within 5 yards of the LOS, thereafter is a 10-yard penalty.
Passing

There can be only one forward pass per play. A forward pass is defined as a live ball thrown toward the opponent's goal line.

If the passer/runner is beyond the L.O.S. and the football is released forward, an illegal Forward/Pass has occurred; this will result in a 5-yard penalty from POS and loss of that (not an additional) down if accepted. Illegal forward passes will be marked from P.O.I.

Once the ball has crossed the L.O.S., in the air or in possession of a player, it cannot be passed forward, even if the ball is brought back behind the L.O.S. (Illegal Forward Pass).
Quarterbacks

## ROUGHING THE PASSER: This is when the passer is hit before, during, or after a pass. Penalty will be tacked on to the end of the play. 15-yard penalty and AFD

The Quarterback is 100% protected on every play. There may be no contact whatsoever whether the ball has been tipped or not. Contact caused by the QB’s follow through is a penalty if the defenders hands are raised. It is the responsibility of the defender to keep the hands down and go for the flag if they are close to the QB.

QB may not run past the LOS.
## Center Snap

The ball must be snapped to the Quarterback between the centers legs and without touching the ground. Should the ball touch the ground it shall be declared dead at the spot.

A false movement of the football by the center after he is set shall constitute encroachment. At all times the ball shall be snapped from the center of the field or the spot marked by the official ball marker.

Direct Snaps are Legal; but there must be a clear and immediate exchange of the ball between the center and the quarterback.

No center sneaks
## Ball Carrier

The responsibility of avoiding contact rests with the ball carrier. He must show the officials he made an effort to avoid contact. The ball carrier will not deliberately run or drive into a defensive player. A ball carrier may spin but must realize that while spinning or jumping he is in a "State of Non-Control" and should contact occur as a result of his uncontrolled momentum, he will be penalized. The ball carrier may jump over a player on the ground. The "Stiff Arm" is illegal. Penalty: 10 yards from L.O.S. (if behind the line) and repeat the down. Or from P.O.I. (if beyond the L.O.S.) and loss of down.

A player may not jump forward to advance the football. The only time it is legal for the runner to jump is to avoid contact with a player who has fallen on the field. (Otherwise it’s a penalty.)

The ball carrier shall not protect his flags by blocking with his hand, arm, head or ball. The defensive player must have a clear opportunity to pull his flags. Flag guarding will be marked 10-yards from the POI and loss of the current down.

On punt returns or interceptions any of the above will be marked off from the P.O.I. and first down.
Diving and Jumping

Ball carriers may not dive or jump forward in an effort to gain extra yardage. Diving is defined as a player clearly leaving both feet stretched out in an aggressive attempt to gain extra yards. Jumping is allowed to avoid contact with a player on the ground, however jumping into or on a defensive player is illegal.
Fumble

Forward offensive fumbles will result in ball being marked dead at the point of fumble. Backward fumbles (including missed snaps or laterals) will be marked at point where ball hits the ground or goes out of bounds.

Note: The kicking team cannot recover Punts.
# Defensive

## RUSHING THE QB  
All attempts at rushing the QB must begin seven (7) yards behind the line of scrimmage on the defensive side of the ball. There is no minimum or maximum number of players that can rush the QB. The referee will provide the seven (7) yard marker for which the rusher must begin. Rusher can reset before rushing to avoid a penalty. Illegal rush – 5-yard penalty
Note: If there is a handoff, all defensive players are allowed to pass the line of scrimmage at any time.
## Pass Interference
Pass Interference Rules shall apply to any pass made from behind the L.O.S., whether it is a forward pass or a lateral pass, and applies to both offensive and defensive players. After the pass is in the air, neither pass receiver nor defender may touch the other until one of them touches the ball, or else offensive or defensive pass interference may be called. If contact occurs after one of them touches the ball, then pass interference cannot be called unless
